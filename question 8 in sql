-- Step 1: Create the found_equipment table
CREATE TABLE found_equipment (
    equipment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    instructions TEXT,
    count INT DEFAULT 0
);

-- Step 2: Insert initial data into found_equipment from the Equipment table
INSERT INTO found_equipment (equipment_id, name, instructions, count)
SELECT e.equipment_id, e.name, e.instructions, 0
FROM Equipment e
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE count = count;

-- Step 3: Create a trigger to update the count in found_equipment
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER update_found_equipment
